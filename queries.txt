queries
Directions
Now that your database is established, here are the queries that we’d like you 
to run:

First, while running python -i model.py, try using the included functions 
(all_employees_nav() and all_employees_join()) to get a list of all employees.
Next, run server.py, navigate to http://localhost:5000, and check out these 
functions as routes – use the Debug Toolbar on the right to note the difference 
between running times and query numbers for the two functions. Why are they 
different? What does that mean?
    _nav function   176ms, 5 queries. Each iteration is another query.
    _join function  8ms, 1 query. eager join loads before iteration.

Run python -i model.py again, and grab the employee object with the name 
‘Cynthia Dueltgen.’
    base_q = Employee.query.filter_by(name='Cynthia Dueltgen')
    cyn = base_q.one()

What department is she in? (Show the object for her department.)
    cyn.dept
    
What is the phone number of the department that Cynthia is in?
    cyn.dept.phone
    
Find all employees whose department we don’t know.
    base2 = Employee.query.filter_by(dept_code = None)
    base2.all() 
    
Get a list of tuples with just the name of everyone whose favorite color is 
orange.
    db.session.query(Employee.name).filter_by(fav_color='orange').all()
    
Find all employees who work in ‘Administration.’
    Employee.query.filter_by(dept_code = 'admin').all()
